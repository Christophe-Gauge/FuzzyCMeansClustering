Computer Vision Applications in C# - Fuzzy C-means Clustering

A straightforward implementation of the Fuzzy C-means Clustering algorithm in C# was previously published in [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/91675/Computer-Vision-Applications-with-C-Fuzzy-C-means-).

This code is a modified version created as an implementation of the research paper: ”Modified Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithm with Spatial Distance to Cluster Center of Gravity”, presented in the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Information and Retrieval, Taichung, Taiwan doi: [10.1109/ISM.2010.53](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2010.53).
